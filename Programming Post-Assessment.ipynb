    "Lora began working as a cashier in their local supermarket for her first job ever. Cash is always limited, so she tries to return change with as few coins as possible. For example, last night a lady bought a $3.45 milk carton with a $5 bill. Lora quickly skimmed through the cash in the register and found that she had the following denominations of coins: $0.01, $0.10, $0.20, $0.50,  $1.00. Although her stash of coins is limited, we can assume that Lora always has at least one combination of coins to match any amount of change due. Lora always follows the following steps to determine how to return the change with the least amount of coins as possible:\n",

Provide a brief explanation for whether or not this algorithm guarantees Lora to find the combination of coins for the change with the least number of coins for any change amount and set of coins she has available. If you think it is, justify this fully, and suggest an improvement or another algorithm to make the process more efficient. If you think this algorithm isn’t guaranteed to find the best solution, describe a specific suggestion for how to alter (change/add/remove) the algorithm’s steps to improve its effectiveness. Justify why your suggestions would be beneficial and if there are any remaining limitations to your improved version of the algorithm.

Imagine every house in San Francisco has a unique number ranging from 1 to infinity. Collatz has discovered a few things about the thief’s behavior. The first is that he never stays in the same house for more than a day; as a new day dawns he moves to a new house to hide. Attempting to stay unpredictable, the thief determines the new house in this manner: if the current house number (lets call it n) is even, the thief will move to the house n/2 next. If the house number (n) is odd, he’ll move to the house 3n + 1. Luckily, Collatz is aware of this behavior.
